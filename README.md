# Dichromate
A Chromium based browser that focuses on privacy and security that was made to keep the corpse of [Hexavalent](https://github.com/Hexavalent-Browser/Hexavalent-Archive) alive after its untimely death. It is released under a new name and logo to avoid copyright infringement. 

New features will be few and far between. 

# Things to keep in mind

Dichromate is a hobbyist browser. It is stable enough for production use, but it is not recommended.

All releases are now automatic, but updated installers will not be released as fast as the patches.
